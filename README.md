This repository contains implementation code for pix2pix GAN(https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) and cycleGAN(https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593). To run the model, you need to edit X and Y(in config, datasets, train) with the datasets you want it to be trained upon. I've shown some results implementing it on satellite images to maps dataset
